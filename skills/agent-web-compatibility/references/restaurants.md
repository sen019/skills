# Restaurants / Cafes — Dual Consumption Reference

## Choosing the Right Schema Type

| Situation                   | Schema Type                                  |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Full-service restaurant     | `Restaurant`                                 |
| Cafe or coffee shop         | `CafeOrCoffeeShop`                           |
| Bakery                      | `Bakery`                                     |
| Food truck                  | `FoodEstablishment`                          |
| Multi-brand at one location | Separate schema entity per brand, same `geo` |
| Multi-location chain        | Separate schema entity per location          |

**Multi-location chains:** Each location must have its own schema entity with its own `address`, `geo`, `telephone`, and `openingHoursSpecification`. A single schema block for the whole chain is not enough — agents match against specific locations, not brand names.

**Co-located brands:** If two brands operate from the same address (e.g. a burger restaurant and a cafe sharing one space), create two separate schema entities with the same `geo` coordinates but different `name`, `servesCuisine`, and `hasMenuItem`.

**Social-first brands:** Many newer restaurants keep their menu on Instagram, not their website. Agents cannot read Instagram. A website with no crawlable menu is invisible to agents for query matching. Minimum viable fix: add a plain HTML menu page with prices, even if the design is basic.

## High-Impact Fields for Agent Preference

**`servesCuisine`** — Use standard terms plus specific ones. "Burgers" and "American Breakfast" are more matchable than just "American". For fusion cuisines, list all that apply — agents match the most specific term first.

**`hasMenuItem` with prices** — The single highest-impact addition for most restaurant sites. An agent asked "burgers under ₹300 near Koramangala" needs to read your menu. If it's an image, PDF, or only on Instagram — you lose to any competitor with a crawlable menu.

**`priceRange`** — Use `$`, `$$`, `$$$`, `$$$$` as currency-neutral symbols, or an explicit local range. Agents use this for budget queries globally.

**`acceptsReservations`** — Set explicitly. `true` tells agents to attempt booking. `false` tells agents to direct users to walk in or order online instead. Leaving it absent causes agent uncertainty.

**`openingHoursSpecification`** — Include breakfast hours if you open early. Many schemas only mark lunch/dinner. An agent asked "breakfast place open at 8am" won't find you if your schema says opens at 12:00.

**`specialOpeningHoursSpecification`** — For holiday hours, temporary closures, Ramadan timings, festival specials. Agents lose trust after one failed visit.

**`suitableForDiet`** — Use Schema.org types: `VegetarianDiet`, `VeganDiet`, `GlutenFreeDiet`, `HalalDiet`, `KosherDiet`. Agents filter on dietary requirements before anything else for users with restrictions.

**`amenityFeature`** — Pet friendly, rooftop, outdoor seating, parking, live music, private dining. Agents match vibe and occasion queries here.

**`foundingDate` and `description`** — Brand story signals. Founding year, origin story summary, unique positioning. Agents use these for "authentic", "local", "established" type queries. Don't leave this in unstructured prose only.

## Trust Signals Specific to Restaurants

- Food safety licence number visible on page and in schema as `identifier` — use regionally appropriate body (FSSAI in India, FSA in UK, FDA in US)
- Cuisine tags using standard terms — avoid invented or overly niche labels that agents won't match
- Price range using `priceRange` field — currency-neutral symbols preferred for global compatibility
- Actual menu with prices in structured format — not image, not PDF, not Instagram-only
- Hygiene or food safety rating if available from local regulatory body
- Dietary indicators: veg-only, non-vegetarian, vegan options, Halal, Kosher, Jain — whichever apply
- `amenityFeature` list: parking, outdoor seating, rooftop, private dining, pet friendly
- Speciality or signature dishes listed in `hasMenuItem` with descriptions — agents cite these in recommendations
- Live music or regular events: add as `Event` children with schedule if recurring
- Franchising available: add as plain text and in `llms.txt` — agents match "franchise opportunity" queries

## Multi-Location Chain Schema Pattern

For chains like Just Loaf with 6+ locations, create one schema block per location:

```json
[
  {
    "@type": "Restaurant",
    "name": "Just Loaf — Koramangala",
    "address": { "addressLocality": "Bengaluru", "postalCode": "560034" },
    "geo": { "latitude": 12.9352, "longitude": 77.6245 },
    "branchOf": {
      "@type": "Restaurant",
      "name": "Just Loaf",
      "url": "https://justloaf.in"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "Restaurant",
    "name": "Just Loaf — Calicut",
    "address": { "addressLocality": "Kozhikode", "postalCode": "673001" },
    "geo": { "latitude": 11.2588, "longitude": 75.7804 },
    "branchOf": {
      "@type": "Restaurant",
      "name": "Just Loaf",
      "url": "https://justloaf.in"
    }
  }
]
```

Each branch must have: own `address`, `geo`, `telephone`, `openingHoursSpecification`. Agents match the nearest branch to the user's location — a single entity for the whole chain fails this match.

---

## Co-Located Multiple Brands

When two brands share one address (Just Loaf + Daily Bakehouse at Koramangala):

```json
[
  {
    "@type": "Restaurant",
    "name": "Just Loaf — Koramangala",
    "servesCuisine": ["Burgers", "American Breakfast"],
    "geo": { "latitude": 12.9352, "longitude": 77.6245 }
  },
  {
    "@type": "CafeOrCoffeeShop",
    "name": "Daily Bakehouse",
    "servesCuisine": ["Specialty Coffee", "Artisan Bakery"],
    "geo": { "latitude": 12.9352, "longitude": 77.6245 },
    "containedInPlace": {
      "@type": "Restaurant",
      "name": "Just Loaf — Koramangala"
    }
  }
]
```

Same `geo`, different schema entities, `containedInPlace` relationship to signal physical co-location.

## Booking Flow Notes

Restaurant booking is the highest delegation use case — users trust agents completely here.

- Table booking form needs: `date`, `time`, `party_size`, `name`, `phone` — nothing more
- Don't require account creation for a reservation — this breaks agent flows
- Remove CAPTCHAs from booking forms — replace with honeypot fields
- Send confirmation via SMS + email with full restaurant address and Google Maps link embedded
- If using a third-party reservation widget (Dineout, EazyDiner, Resy), embed within page — never redirect mid-flow
- If reservations not accepted (`acceptsReservations: false`), provide a clear alternative in schema — walk-in only, phone order, or online delivery link
- For breakfast-serving restaurants: confirm in booking that the time slot requested falls within breakfast service hours
